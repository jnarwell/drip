!!! danger "PLANNING DOCUMENTATION ONLY"
    **No hardware exists. No simulations completed. These are conceptual targets only.**

## Electrical Safety

### High Voltage Systems (220V AC)
- Main power input rated at 63A
- Ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) required
- Electrical isolation barriers mandatory
- Arc flash protection required for maintenance

### Low Voltage DC Systems
- 48V DC main distribution (up to 200A)
- Touch-safe connectors required
- Overcurrent protection on all branches
- Emergency shutdown capability

## Thermal Safety

### High Temperature Zones
- Crucible system: up to 1500°C operational
- Heated bed: up to 850°C operational
- Induction heater: 3kW power, surface temps >200°C

### Safety Measures
