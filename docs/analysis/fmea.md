# Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

## Overview

This FMEA identifies potential failure modes, their effects, and mitigation strategies for the Acoustic Manufacturing System.

## Risk Priority Number (RPN) Calculation

**RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection**

- **Severity (S)**: 1-10 (10 = catastrophic)
- **Occurrence (O)**: 1-10 (10 = very frequent)
- **Detection (D)**: 1-10 (10 = undetectable)

## Critical Failure Modes (RPN > 100)

| Component | Failure Mode | Effect | S | O | D | RPN | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------------|--------|---|---|---|-----|------------|
| PSU | Output failure | System shutdown | 9 | 2 | 2 | 36 | Redundant PSU, monitoring |
| Transducer | Element cracking | Field distortion | 7 | 3 | 5 | 105 | Spare units, monitoring |
| Crucible | Thermal shock | Material spill | 10 | 2 | 3 | 60 | Controlled heating, sensors |
| FPGA | Logic corruption | Control loss | 8 | 2 | 4 | 64 | Watchdog, redundancy |
| Cooling pump | Pump failure | Overheating | 8 | 3 | 2 | 48 | Flow monitoring, backup |
