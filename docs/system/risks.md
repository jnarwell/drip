## Risk Response Strategy

### High Priority Risks (Red Zone)
- **Immediate Action Required**
- Weekly monitoring
- Dedicated mitigation resources
- Executive visibility

### Medium Priority Risks (Yellow Zone)
- **Active Management**
- Bi-weekly review
- Mitigation plans in place
- Regular status updates

### Low Priority Risks (Green Zone)
- **Monitor Only**
- Monthly review
- Contingency plans documented
- Trigger points defined

## Contingency Plans

### Technical Contingencies
1. **Acoustic System Failure**
   - Spare transducers on hand (20% extra)
   - Alternative array configurations tested
   - Manual override capability

2. **Thermal System Issues**
   - Backup heating elements
   - Secondary cooling loop
   - Temperature limit overrides

### Schedule Contingencies
1. **Component Delays**
   - Alternative suppliers identified
   - Critical parts ordered early
   - Parallel assembly paths

2. **Testing Delays**
   - Extended hours approved
   - External test facilities identified
   - Reduced scope options

### Budget Contingencies
1. **Cost Overruns**
   - 20% contingency allocated
   - Phased implementation option
   - Scope reduction plan

## Risk Monitoring

Monthly risk review meetings include:
- Risk register updates
- Mitigation effectiveness
- New risk identification
- Action item tracking
