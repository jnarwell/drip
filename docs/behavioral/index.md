# Behavioral Models

## Overview
Behavioral models will capture the planned dynamic operation of the DRIP acoustic manufacturing system, defining how components should interact over time to achieve precise droplet control and material deposition.

## Model Categories

### 🎯 Control Behaviors
Real-time control loops and predictive algorithms for droplet steering.
[View Control Models →](control-behavior.md)

### 🔄 System States  
Operational modes and state transitions throughout the build process.
[View State Machines →](system-states.md)

### ⏱️ Interaction Sequences
Component interactions and timing constraints for critical operations.
[View Sequences →](control-sequences.md)

### 🌡️ Thermal Dynamics
Heat transfer models and cooling rate predictions for material control.
[View Thermal Models →](thermal-dynamics.md)

## Integration with System Architecture

These behavioral models are intended to implement the requirements defined in our [System Requirements](../system/requirements.md) and will interface through the connections specified in our [ICDs](../icds/index.md).

### Target Performance Metrics (Unvalidated)
- **Control Loop Frequency**: Target 1 kHz (1ms cycle time)
- **Steering Accuracy**: Target ±0.3mm per SR002
- **Cooling Rate**: Target >1000°C/s per SR010
- **Response Time**: Target <200ms predictive lead

## Verification Approach
Each behavioral model will include verification constraints that must map to our [Design Verification Matrix](../verification/matrix.md).

## Model Implementation Status

| Model | Status | Work Completed | Next Steps |
|-------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Droplet Control Behavior | 📋 Conceptual | Requirements defined | MATLAB simulation planned |
| System States | 📋 Planned | State diagram drafted | Formal modeling needed |
| Control Sequences | 📋 Planned | Timing targets set | Simulation required |
| Thermal Dynamics | 📋 Conceptual | Physics equations identified | FEA analysis planned |

**Note:** All models are conceptual only. No simulations have been run.
