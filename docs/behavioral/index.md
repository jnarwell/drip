# Behavioral Models

## Overview
Behavioral models capture the dynamic operation of the DRIP acoustic manufacturing system, defining how components interact over time to achieve precise droplet control and material deposition.

## Model Categories

### 🎯 Control Behaviors
Real-time control loops and predictive algorithms for droplet steering.
[View Control Models →](control-behavior.md)

### 🔄 System States  
Operational modes and state transitions throughout the build process.
[View State Machines →](system-states.md)

### ⏱️ Interaction Sequences
Component interactions and timing constraints for critical operations.
[View Sequences →](control-sequences.md)

### 🌡️ Thermal Dynamics
Heat transfer models and cooling rate predictions for material control.
[View Thermal Models →](thermal-dynamics.md)

## Integration with System Architecture

These behavioral models directly implement the requirements defined in our [System Requirements](../system/requirements.md) and interface through the connections specified in our [ICDs](../icds/index.md).

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Control Loop Frequency**: 1 kHz (1ms cycle time)
- **Steering Accuracy**: ±0.3mm per SR002
- **Cooling Rate**: >1000°C/s per SR010
- **Response Time**: <200ms predictive lead

## Verification Approach
Each behavioral model includes verification constraints that map directly to our [Design Verification Matrix](../verification/matrix.md).
