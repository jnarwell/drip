# Requirements Traceability (Planning Phase)
!!! danger "PLANNING DOCUMENTATION ONLY"
    **No hardware exists. No simulations completed. These are conceptual targets only.**

## Document Purpose
This document will track requirements through implementation. Currently, all items are conceptual targets.

## Requirements Status

### Defined Requirements (Targets Only)
All requirements represent design targets and have not been validated:

| ID | Requirement | Target Value | Validation Plan | Status |
|----|-------------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| SR001 | Frequency | 40kHz ±100Hz | Spectrum analyzer | 📋 Plan Only |
| SR002 | Accuracy | ±0.3mm | High-speed camera | 📋 Plan Only |
| SR003 | Temperature | 700-1580°C | Thermocouple array | 📋 Plan Only |
| SR009 | Chamber temp | <300°C | Thermal mapping | 📋 Plan Only |
| SR010 | Cooling rate | >1000°C/s | Pyrometer | 📋 Plan Only |

| SR013 | Thermal camera | 32Hz | Latency test | 📋 Plan Only |
| SR014 | Control loop | <3ms | Oscilloscope | 📋 Plan Only |
| SR015 | Filtration | MERV 13 | Flow measurement | 📋 Plan Only |

### Future Verification Approach

#### Phase 1: Simulation (Not Started)
- [ ] COMSOL acoustic modeling
- [ ] ANSYS thermal analysis  
- [ ] MATLAB control loops

#### Phase 2: Prototype Testing (Future)
- [ ] Component characterization
- [ ] Subsystem validation
- [ ] System integration

**Current Status:** No verification work has begun.

## Gap Analysis

### Requirements Definition Status
- ⏳ SR001-SR003: Core functionality requirements drafted
- ⏳ SR004-SR008: Performance requirements need refinement
- ⏳ SR009-SR011: Safety requirements preliminary
- ⏳ SR012-SR015: Operational requirements in progress

### Model Development Needed
1. **Control Behavior**: Algorithm development required
2. **System States**: State machine design needed
3. **Control Sequences**: Timing analysis required
4. **Thermal Dynamics**: Physics modeling needed

## Continuous Verification (Future Implementation)

When implemented, behavioral models will include built-in constraints:

```sysml
// Example future constraints
constraint controlLoopTiming {
    doc /* Target: totalLoopTime < 3[ms] per SR014 */
}

constraint coolingRateRequirement {
    doc /* Target: coolingRate > 1000[°C/s] per SR010 */
}

constraint chamberTemperatureLimit {
    doc /* Target: all positions { temperature < 300[°C] } per SR009 */
}
```

These constraints will generate runtime alerts if requirements are violated during future testing.
