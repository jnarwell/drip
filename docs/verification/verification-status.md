# Verification Status (Reconciled)
!!! danger "PLANNING DOCUMENTATION ONLY"
    **No hardware exists. No simulations completed. These are conceptual targets only.**

## Current System Verification Status

This page shows the planned verification approach. No testing can occur until hardware is available.

### Status Legend
- 📋 **Planned**: Test procedure defined, awaiting hardware
- 📝 **Draft**: Test procedure being developed
- ⏳ **Future**: Test to be defined later
- 🎯 **Target**: Performance goal to validate

## Verification Planning Summary

**📋 Planning Phase**: All verification activities are in planning stage:
1. Test procedures being drafted
2. Test equipment requirements identified
3. Acceptance criteria defined
4. No hardware available for testing

### Current Status:
- All requirements are in **PLANNING PHASE**
- Test procedures documented for future use
- Awaiting prototype assembly

## Future Steps (After Hardware Available)
1. Assembly of prototype hardware
2. Procurement of test equipment
3. Execution of test procedures
4. Documentation of actual results
