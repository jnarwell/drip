# Verification Status (Reconciled)

## Current System Verification Status

This page shows the true verification status based on actual test completion and evidence.

### Status Legend
- 📋 **Not Started**: No testing has begun
- 🔄 **In Testing**: Test is currently in progress  
- ✅ **Verified**: Test complete with passing results
- ❌ **Failed**: Test complete with failing results

## Verification Progress Summary

**⚠️ Important**: Verification status is only marked as "Verified" when:
1. Test has been completed
2. Test results show PASS
3. Test report has been generated
4. Evidence files have been attached

### Current Status:
- All requirements are currently **NOT STARTED**
- No false verification claims
- True system state reflected

## Next Steps
1. Begin executing test procedures
2. Document test results with evidence
3. Update verification status based on actual completion
